# gpa
Helping others to decide weather to drop a class or not and how will it effect their gpa,

The values are mapped according to my current course catalouge, this seems funny but in order to recover from an F we need four A's.

Feel free to map accroding to your current GPA and Cirriculum.

This might help others while taking a decision.

To run the script "python3 gpa.py"
